# React

https://react.dev/

A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It's
maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React allows developers to create large
web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes. The main concept in React is the
component, which can be composed to create complex UIs. React uses a virtual DOM to improve performance by minimizing
direct manipulation of the actual DOM.
