Software Development is such an interesting careerâ€Š-â€Šfrom working remotely to working in a large tech hub to checking in from the beachâ€Š-â€Šeach person works in a wildly different way and thatâ€™s why we love it!

We wanted to know what gets devs started, what keeps them dreaming and how they workâ€Š-â€Šso we asked some of our users!

Gregâ€™s Workshape

Greg has written us a brief and eventful excerpt of time with technology. Heâ€Šdiscusses the technology he started with (which people my age have only seen in vintage stores ðŸ™ƒ) and the changes in the tech landscape heâ€™s observed.

Gregâ€™s story
Iâ€™m 42 and Iâ€™ve been programming since High School. 
Like a lot of programmers my age, it all started when my mom bought us a Tandy 1000. It came with a 5 1/4 diskettes for MS BASIC.

I was hooked, I got what books I could find from the library on MS Basic; no Internet back then, well at least not like we know it.

I remember programming things like a word processor, games like snake, tic-tac-toe, maze games etc. When my high school offered a basic computer class, I took it and learnt more than the teacher.

After high school, I didnâ€™t have the money for college nor the skills for a good job so I joined the army.

I knew I wanted a high-tech job so I did my best on their test, and was able to get a Top Secure job as a Satellite Communication Systems Operator-Maintainer (31S).

It was great because not only did they teach me to be a responsible adult, but I learnt the details of electronics down to how a transistor works and how to troubleshoot a problem by taking the proper logical steps. Whilst I was in the Army I continued to learn by taking college classes and learning on my own.

I was able to get my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.

After 6 years of service, I decided to get out. 
I found my first real job in Santa Monica, CA. They were delivering high-speed Internet and Voice (VOIP) to remote countries via satellites. Here I learned all about the equipment it takes to make the Internet to work; Routers, Switches, etc.

After about 3â€“4 years the company was bought out by a larger company and a group of us decided to branch off and start a new calling card company. This was my first time with a small company I think we only had 4 people. I was the CTO but with so few people I had to do everything from setting up routers to setting up our website. This is also the time that I started with AMP (Apache, MySQL, PHP) which is still my main focus today.

After 2 years, the company wasnâ€™t making money so we had to close the doors and move on. I tried finding a normal job but was not having any luck and between interviews. I started my own company VoipTools using my contacts and I was able to do ok. That plus some side jobs meant I was able to pay the bills.

But it was just me, I had to do everything on my own. This taught me a lot including the joys of working from home. Which was an important turning point for me. I know it isnâ€™t for everyone, but for me it works and I do not see myself going back to a 9â€“5 job.

A few years into that, I got together with an old friend from my first job in Santa Monica. He was starting a new business as a mobile phone service provider and wanted my help getting it going. It went well for a couple of years so I let my side jobs die. But like all of my previous jobs this one didnâ€™t last either.

After about 5 years, they let me go due to cut backs. Which I was a little bitter about because I helped start it and my so called friend didnâ€™t give me any warning. One day, he told me they were going to have to let me go. But that is life, I guess.

Still, itâ€™s a great time be a developer.

I havenâ€™t had any problems finding work. I started with Upworks and then found someone on Dice. 
That brings us to today.

Working from home, in a house in a small town in Oregon, working for a startup with only 2â€“3 people trying to make a product that will last me another few yearsâ€¦
