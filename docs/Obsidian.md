> Obsidian is a powerful knowledge management and note-taking application that uses local storage and Markdown syntax. 

# Summary
Obsidian Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax used in the Obsidian application, a note-taking and knowledge management tool.

It is an extension of the common Markdown syntax and includes additional features specific to Obsidian, such as support for creating connections between notes using [double brackets](app://obsidian.md/double%20brackets), linking to specific headings within a note, and embedding various types of media like images and PDFs. Obsidian Markdown is designed to create interconnected and structured notes for effective information management.
