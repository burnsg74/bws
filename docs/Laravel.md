Laravel is a free, open-source PHP web framework, intended for the development of web applications following the
model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern. Some of the features of Laravel are a modular packaging system with a
dedicated dependency manager, different ways for accessing relational databases, utilities that aid in application
deployment and maintenance, and its orientation toward syntactic sugar.
