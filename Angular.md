# Angular

https://angular.dev/

Angular is a platform and framework for building client-side applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript.
Developed and maintained by Google, Angular simplifies the development and testing of web applications by providing a
comprehensive set of tools for creating robust and scalable applications. It features a component-based architecture,
enabling the creation of reusable UI components, and offers services like dependency injection, data binding, and
templating to streamline development processes. Angular is suited for building both simple applications and complex,
enterprise-level web apps, offering high performance and scalability. It has evolved significantly from its initial
release, AngularJS, to the current Angular versions, incorporating ongoing improvements in functionality and developer
experience.
