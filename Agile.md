Agile project management involves several types of meetings, also known as ceremonies or events, each serving a unique purpose:

1. **Sprint Planning**: This is for planning the work that will be done in the upcoming Sprint (two to four weeks of work). The team discusses and prioritizes tasks in the product backlog.
2. **Daily Stand-up or Scrum**: A short 15-minute meeting where each team member discusses what they did yesterday, what they're working on today, and any obstacles they're facing.
3. **Sprint Review**: A meeting at the end of the sprint where the team presents what has been achieved in the sprint. Stakeholders provide feedback that could influence the next sprint.
4. **Sprint Retrospective**: This is where the team reviews the past sprint, discussing what went well, what challenges were faced, and actions for improvement in the next sprint.
5. **Backlog Refinement (Grooming)**: This is a regular session where product backlog items are reviewed and refined, in preparation for upcoming sprints.
6. **Release Planning**: This is a high-level meeting to plan the overall direction of the product over the next few months.

Note: While these are common in many Agile-based projects, Agile is flexible and not all projects may include all of these meetings or may have additional meetings depending on their specific process/framework (e.g., Scrum, Kanban).
